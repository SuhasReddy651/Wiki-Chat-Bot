# Wiki-Chat-Bot
Chat Bot that answers based on the information that has already been scraped from wikipedia using wikipedia's API. A small custom chit chat language model is included to provide summaries of the topics. A small language model is also added to get any information that is outside the scraped data. That answers can be pretentious.
